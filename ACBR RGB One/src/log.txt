  Controls the rover used for the HSU Foundation & Be The Magic Foundation Summer Class 2021 (Wizzy Rover).

  Hx: 
  05.24.21 DJP - Started coding
  05.25.21 DJP - Added headlight functionality
  05.29.21 DJP - Added obstacle avoidance LiDar sensors
  06.01.21 DJP - Added topside leds for better visibility of rover status in sunlight
  07.07.21 DJP - Changed "star" button on controller to show a red & blue back & forth fade
  07.07.21 DJP - Tweaked lightbar light sensitivity due to new location of the photoresistor
  07.07.21 DJP - Tweaked LiDar sensitivity due to new location of the LiDar sensors
  07.29.21 DJP - Incorporated Doug & Sarah's in class changes
  08.03.21 DJP - Moved code from the OnNotify() to the Loop() to resolve BT response issues between the PS3 and the ESP32
  08.04.21 DJP - Changed ReadLiDarSensors() to not clear the ground effect leds between reads when ground effect is on
  07.22.22 DJP - Changed SetupLiDarSensort() to not entire a never ending while loop when a LiDar sensor fails to initialize
  07.23.22 DJP - Added toggle option to turn on/off LiDar via PS3 L1 & R1 combination
  08.03.22 DJP - Added ground effect lighting
  08.15.22 DJP - Added Bit-Wizards demo mode, by setting pin 34 high the ground effect lighting and FLB strobe blue & yellow
                    keeping pin 34 low keeps the rover in normal mode (non-Demo mode)...for testing, I used a jumper between pin 34
                    and pin 0 to turn on demo mode, leaving 34 empty or using a pin already in low state (IE pin 2) will take it out 
                    of demo mode...this can be done on the fly
  07.20.23 DJP - Changed debug led functionality as follows:
                  1) The blue led on the hat of the Wizzy controller board will blink 3 times if not BT connection and will otherwise
                     stay on (blue)
                  2) The white eyes on the face of the Wizzy controller board are the debug leds and will blink accordingly depending 
                     on the issue detected
  07.20.23 DJP - Changed front & rear lightbars to function as one lightbar
  07.20.23 DJP - Added ground effect lightbars as part of the standard rover startup
