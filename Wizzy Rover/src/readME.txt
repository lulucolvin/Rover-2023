07.25.2023 Ran into an issue with platform io Platform version
            Must have the version 5.0.0 of the Espressif 32 Platform
07.25.2023 Found that Windows 11 may need a separately installed driver to compile code onto the esp32 controller
            the driver can be downloaded here: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
            We used the CP210x Universal Windows Driver v. 11.3.0
